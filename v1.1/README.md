### Breadboard Components

Designed to house breadboard modules of "standard" size:
* Main Module:
  * 10 Columns, 63 Rows
  * 35.56mm wide (excluding interconnect lugs), 165.1mm long
* Power Rail Module:
  * 9.525mm wide (excluding interconnect lugs), 165.1mm long  

Designed to house two main modules and three power rails on each side of the pcb, if desired.

Absolute maximum board area in which to stick breadboard modules is 103.63mm wide by 167.26mm long.
